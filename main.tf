# * HashiCorp Beginner's Guide to Using Terraform on Azure

# This Terraform configuration will create the following:
#
# Resource group with a virtual network and subnet
# An Ubuntu Linux server running Apache

# * Shared infrastructure resources

# The latest version of the Azure provider breaks backward compatibility.
# TODO: Update this code to use the latest provider.
provider "azurerm" {

# First we'll create a resource group. In Azure every resource belongs to a 
# resource group. Think of it as a container to hold all your resources. 
# You can find a complete list of Azure resources supported by Terraform here:
# https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/

# The next resource is a Virtual Network. We can dynamically place it into the
# resource group without knowing its name ahead of time. Terraform handles all
# of that for you, so everything is named consistently every time. Say goodbye
# to weirdly-named mystery resources in your Azure Portal. To see how all this
# works visually, run `terraform graph` and copy the output into the online
# GraphViz tool: http://www.webgraphviz.com/

# Next we'll build a subnet to run our VMs in. These variables can be defined 
# via environment variables, a config file, or command line flags. Default 
# values will be used if the user does not override them. You can find all the
# default variables in the variables.tf file. You can customize this demo by
# making a copy of the terraform.tfvars.example file.
